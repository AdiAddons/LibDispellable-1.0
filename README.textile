LibDispellable-1.0 aims at helping to test if the player can really dispel an enemy buff or a friend debuff.

The current Blizzard implementation of curable buff filter ("HARMFUL RAID") does not take talents into account. There is no way to test for buffs the player can dispel on her enemies. LibDispellable-1.0 provides methods to test both defensive and offensive dispel, taking care of healer talents for Magic dispel.
